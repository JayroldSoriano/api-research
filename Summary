##  Overall:

1. Most Philippine POS providers (Condor, Divergent, UTAK, Kintoz, Reach, OrderPin, Storehub) have limited or restricted API visibility, often requiring form submission, credentials, or direct vendor engagement.
2. Qashier and OrderPin are slightly more open but still gated.
3. GlobalPayments is the only one with full, public, enterprise-grade API documentation and working sample requests.
